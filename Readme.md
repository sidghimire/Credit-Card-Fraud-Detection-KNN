# Credit Card Fraud Detection with KNN (.md)

This code implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It utilizes the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, potentially available on Kaggle.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

## Dependencies

    pandas
    scikit-learn (specifically sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.neighbors, sklearn.metrics, and sklearn.model_selection)

## Functionality

This script performs the following tasks:

    Data Loading: Reads a CSV file (creditcard.csv) containing credit card transaction details.
    Data Preprocessing:
        Handles missing values, potentially by dropping rows with missing entries in the 'Class' column (indicating fraudulent or genuine transaction).
        Separates features (X) from the target variable (y). Features represent the transaction details, and the target variable indicates if the transaction is fraudulent (Class = 1) or genuine (Class = 0).
        Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split to ensure the model is evaluated on unseen data.
        Standardizes the features in both training and testing sets using StandardScaler to improve KNN performance by putting features on a similar scale.
    Model Training:
        Initializes a KNN classifier with n_neighbors=5. This signifies the model will consider the labels of 5 nearest neighbors in the training data to predict the class of a new data point.
        Trains the KNN model on the prepared training data (X_train, y_train).
    Model Evaluation:
        Predicts the class labels for the testing data (X_test) using the trained model.
        Prints a classification report summarizing the model's performance on the testing data. This report may include metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for both fraudulent and genuine transactions.
        Prints the overall accuracy score of the model on the testing data.

Note

This is a basic implementation of KNN for credit card fraud detection. Consider exploring hyperparameter tuning and other machine learning algorithms for potentially better performance.
